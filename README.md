# Book2Audio 

## Where I am 

At current the selected work must be manualy split into digestable pieces for processing through online services such as AWS Polly
The audio must then be downloaded and converted manually. I have been stuck on blocking segments for upload to a bucket. 

## Where I am Going
My todo list includes:
- :x: Creation of a front end allowing cloud selection (google, AWS, Azure, Watson) voice selection and monitoring of process.
- :x: splitting text to manageable size for s3 buckets
- :x: automate download and splice audio
- :x: auto update project guttenberg csv 
- :x: use open ai to give a book summary
- :x: integrate dalle to provide visuals
- :x: Integrate video conversion to
